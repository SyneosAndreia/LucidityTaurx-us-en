          <h1 class="v-pad-bottom-23">Privacy Policy</h1>
          <p class="black-text v-pad-bottom-23">This policy explains how X Factor Advertising, Syneos Health and/or study sponsor, the operators of this website (also referred to as “we” or “us” in this Privacy Policy), collects and may use information about you that you provide on the screener website, and the actions taken to help protect the privacy of that information. This policy does NOT apply to information that is collected through the website but does not identify you in any way, such as aggregated information about groups (rather than individuals), which we might use to show likely trends or geographic groupings.</p>
          <p class="black-text v-pad-bottom-23">By using the screener website, you consent to the data practices described in this statement. Please do not use the screener website if you do not agree with the terms set forth in this Privacy Policy.</p>
          <p class="blue-text bold-text">What information do we collect?</p>
          <p class="black-text v-pad-bottom-23">In order to determine whether you pre-qualify for a clinical trial for which we are identifying patients, or to identify a clinical research center in your area, we may ask you to provide us with information about yourself. </p>
          <p class="black-text v-pad-bottom-23">The personal information we collect includes your name, email address and phone number, as well as certain other personal information, including health information, necessary to determine if you are an eligible candidate for this clinical trial. </p>
          <p class="black-text v-pad-bottom-23">We only seek health and other personal information that is relevant to this Clinical Trial. </p>
          <p class="blue-text bold-text">Where is the information kept? </p>
          <p class="black-text v-pad-bottom-23">The information collected is stored on secured servers employing technology designed to maintain a secured environment. While reasonable steps are taken to prevent unauthorized access, use, and alteration of Personal Information, we cannot guarantee the absolute security of such information. Please note that no method of transmission over the Internet, or electronic storage, is 100% secure. </p>
          <p class="blue-text bold-text">Who can access the information? </p>
          <p class="black-text v-pad-bottom-23">Your information will be released to the clinical trial site you have chosen if it is determined you may be an eligible candidate for the clinical trial in which you have expressed interest. It may also be accessed in part by X Factor contact coordinators working directly with the clinical trial sites.  </p>
          <p class="blue-text bold-text">Is my information disclosed to anyone else? </p>
          <p class="black-text v-pad-bottom-23">Your personal information may be disclosed if and to the extent required by law, court order, or other governmental authority, and may be used or disclosed for the specific purposes for which it is collected and as authorized by law. As stated above, your personal information (including your contact information) that you submit will be sent to the participating clinical trial site you have chosen if it appears you are an eligible candidate for the clinical trial. This occurs automatically after your submission of information; the screener website will automatically inform the clinical trial site of your interest in participating in the clinical trial via email and or direct transfer. </p>
          <p class="black-text v-pad-bottom-23">Our website(s) may also use Google Analytics to collect information about how many visitors we receive, what general area they came from, and how they use our website(s). The results help us to improve the services offered. Any data retrieved by us through Google Analytics contains no Personally Identifying Information and is not transmitted back to Google.</p>
          <p class="black-text v-pad-bottom-23">Please note that although this Privacy Policy governs your personal information collected through the screener site as maintained by X Factor Advertising, when your personal information is transferred to others (as provided for in this Privacy Policy), it is no longer covered by this Privacy Policy; rather, it is protected by the Clinical Trial Site’s individual policies, practices and applicable laws.</p>
          <p class="blue-text bold-text">Is my information kept indefinitely?</p>
          <p class="black-text v-pad-bottom-23">All information stored by X Factor Advertising will be kept on our secured servers until the conclusion of the study. Once the study has concluded, all potential patient information that was submitted as part of the online screening process will be destroyed, unless retention of such information was authorized prior to its submission.</p>
          <p class="blue-text bold-text">Are “cookies” put on my device?</p>
          <p class="black-text v-pad-bottom-23">Our websites and/or screener pages employ the use of session cookies, which are pieces of information or markers that the web server sends to your computer when you access our website(s). Session Cookies are sent upon your arrival at our website to provide additional functionality and ease of use. The types of Session Cookies we use typically expire upon logout or a short time thereafter. In any event no Permanent or Perpetual Cookies are used.</p>

          <p class="blue-text bold-text">Can I remove my information? </p>
          <p class="black-text v-pad-bottom-23">You may request to have your information removed from our database prior to its eventual destruction. In the event your information has already been passed to the clinical trial site, you will need to contact them directly to remove your name from their database. To request to have your information deleted or to withdraw from the study, email -  <a href="mailto:Privacy@xfactoradvertising.com?subject=The Lucidity Study">Privacy@xfactoradvertising.com</a>. Please include your name, study name and approximate date you pre-qualified for the study.</p>
